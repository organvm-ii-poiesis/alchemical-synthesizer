## Conceptual Frame: Proteus / Cronus as Absorption Mechanics

This synthesizer is not organized around fixed voice architecture. It is organized around _assimilation_. Proteus represents continuous mutability at the signal level, while Cronus represents irreversible capture and temporal authority. Every module must therefore either transform an incoming signal into something else, or freeze, digest, and re-emit it under new rules. Nothing merely passes through unchanged.

The system treats all signals—audio, CV, gates, clocks, envelopes, metadata—as equally absorbable matter. Once ingested, a signal may be reshaped, time-warped, spectralized, or locked into memory, then released later as a degraded or hybridized form.

## Absorptive Signal Topology

The core topology is radial rather than linear. Signals are pulled inward toward assimilation modules, transformed, then redistributed outward under altered constraints. The synthesizer behaves less like a subtractive chain and more like a metabolic loop.

Proteus modules operate continuously and reversibly. Cronus modules operate discretely and irreversibly. The tension between these two forces defines the system’s character.

## Proteus Layer: Mutable Assimilation

Proteus modules never settle. They ingest signals and immediately reinterpret them according to control pressure.

A _Spectral Skinner_ accepts any audio or CV input and decomposes it into partials or frequency bands. Control voltages do not modulate parameters; they _rewrite weighting rules_. A slow LFO might gradually privilege low harmonics, while a stepped sequence might abruptly promote noise components. The output is never a filtered version of the input; it is a re-expressed identity.

A _Form-Stealer Oscillator_ does not generate waveforms internally. It derives its oscillation kernel from whatever signal is patched into it. If fed noise, it oscillates chaotically. If fed a voice, it oscillates with vocal-like instability. Pitch control constrains the rate of repetition, not the waveform itself.

A _Protean Matrix_ sits between modules and mutates routing itself. Crossfades are asymmetrical. Feedback paths slowly drift. Signal polarity may invert unpredictably. The matrix behaves like a living membrane rather than a router.

* * *

## Cronus Layer: Temporal Capture and Authority

Cronus modules impose finality. Once a signal crosses their boundary, it becomes history.

A _Chronophage Sampler_ captures incoming material only when externally authorized by a gate, comparator, or logic condition. Capture depth is destructive: higher authority settings truncate transients, reduce resolution, or collapse stereo fields. What is stored is not the original signal but its _post-assimilation residue_.

A _Temporal Ossifier_ freezes control signals into rigid trajectories. A flowing envelope becomes a staircase. A clock becomes a fossilized rhythm with missing pulses. Once ossified, modulation can only occur through erosion, not rewriting.

A _Succession Engine_ manages inheritance. When a new signal is captured, it partially overwrites the previous memory rather than replacing it. Older material never disappears; it decays into harmonic ghosts that continue to influence output.

* * *

## Cross-Layer Conflict Mechanics

The system is most alive where Proteus and Cronus collide.

Proteus modules attempt to continuously reshape signals feeding Cronus modules, while Cronus modules enforce capture thresholds that interrupt Protean flow. This creates moments where a signal is caught mid-mutation, producing unstable but repeatable artifacts.

A dedicated _Authority Comparator_ arbitrates these conflicts. It evaluates competing control inputs—gesture, automation, randomness, environmental sensors—and decides whether a signal remains mutable or becomes fixed. Authority can be patched, stolen, or delayed.

* * *

## Control Philosophy

There are no global clocks or master tempos. Time emerges from capture events and decay rates. Rhythm is a byproduct of absorption frequency and release erosion.

Knobs bias tendencies rather than set values. CV inputs redefine meaning rather than scale parameters. Gates are interpreted as permissions, not triggers.

* * *

## Patch Behavior in Practice

A live input is fed into the Spectral Skinner, where slow control voltage pressure gradually exaggerates its upper harmonics. The result is routed into the Form-Stealer Oscillator, which begins oscillating with the input’s spectral fingerprint. That signal passes into the Chronophage Sampler, but capture only occurs when a logic condition derived from envelope slope is satisfied. The captured sound is partially overwritten by the previous sample, then released through the Protean Matrix, where feedback drift causes it to mutate further. Over time, the system develops a lineage of sounds rather than a sequence.

* * *

## Resulting Instrument Identity

This synthesizer does not reward precision or repetition. It rewards _intervention_. Every patch becomes a negotiation between flow and capture, mutation and authority, becoming and memory. Proteus ensures nothing stays stable. Cronus ensures nothing is forgotten.

If you want, the next step can formalize this into a Eurorack-sized module set with concrete I/O specifications, or translate the architecture directly into Pure Data or SuperCollider abstractions with explicit state machines and decay laws.
