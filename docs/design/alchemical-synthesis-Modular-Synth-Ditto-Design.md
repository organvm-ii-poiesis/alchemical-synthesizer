## Modular Synthesizer Concept: **DITTO**

### Core Idea

DITTO is a **meta-module**: a synthesizer organism whose defining behavior is _imitation under constraint_. It does not merely copy another module’s sound; it copies **structural behavior**, **control topology**, and **failure modes**, always imperfectly. Like Ditto, the module is adaptive, plastic, and slightly wrong in ways that are musically productive.

This is not a preset machine. It is a **context-reactive morphic engine** designed to sit inside a modular ecosystem and temporarily become something else.

## System Ontology

DITTO exists as a **shape-shifting substrate**, not a fixed voice. Its identity is defined at runtime by three simultaneous observations of the surrounding patch.

Signal morphology, meaning waveform statistics, spectral centroid drift, zero-crossing density, transient probability.

Control behavior, meaning CV ranges, slew rates, quantization density, rhythmic entropy.

Structural role, meaning whether the observed module behaves like a source, modifier, router, or sink.

DITTO continuously infers these three layers and instantiates an internal approximation.

## Internal Architecture

**Adaptive Analysis Core**  
Incoming audio and CV are analyzed in parallel. Audio analysis extracts envelope topology, harmonic density, and instability metrics. CV analysis extracts rate classes, polarity bias, and modulation intent.

**Morphic Synthesis Core**  
Instead of one oscillator, DITTO contains a _polymorphic kernel_ capable of operating as wavetable, phase-distortion, wavefolded analog model, noise-excited resonator, or control-rate logic oscillator. The kernel reconfigures based on the inferred role.

**Error Engine**  
Perfect copying is forbidden. Every transformation passes through an error field that introduces lag, drift, quantization mismatch, or semantic misinterpretation. This is where personality emerges.

* * *

## Front Panel Semantics

**OBSERVE**  
Controls how aggressively DITTO samples its environment. At low values, it only captures gross behavior. At high values, it attempts near-total mimicry.

**ASSUME**  
Defines how fully DITTO commits to the copied role. Low values keep hybrid identity. High values suppress native character.

**MUTATE**  
Scales the Error Engine. This is not randomness; it is _structured deviation_. At maximum, DITTO becomes a parody of the source.

**MEMORY**  
Temporal persistence of identity. At zero, DITTO is amnesiac. At maximum, it becomes a fossilized clone even after the source disappears.

**FACE**  
A macro bias between three internal stances: signal-faithful, control-faithful, or structure-faithful. You choose _what_ it copies best.

* * *

## Patch Behaviors

When patched after an oscillator, DITTO becomes a second oscillator with similar tuning behavior but unstable harmonic alignment.

When patched after a filter, DITTO becomes a pseudo-filter whose cutoff is inferred rather than explicit, often overshooting resonance behavior.

When patched into a modulation bus, DITTO becomes a modulation generator that copies _gesture_, not waveform, producing eerily similar phrasing.

When patched into silence, DITTO hallucinates identity from noise floor and internal bias, creating ghost modules.

* * *

## System Role in a Rack

DITTO functions as a **wildcard organism**. It is best deployed where rigidity would normally occur: replacing a missing module, destabilizing a fixed voice, or acting as a speculative stand-in during patch exploration.

It encourages _ecological thinking_ in modular synthesis. The rack becomes an environment. Modules become species. DITTO becomes adaptive camouflage.

* * *

## Implementation Notes (Pure Data / SuperCollider)

In Pure Data, DITTO maps cleanly to a graph of parallel analyzers feeding a dynamic subpatch loader, with error injection implemented as parameter skew rather than noise.

In SuperCollider, DITTO is best implemented as a SynthDef factory that rewrites itself based on continuous analysis buffers, using ProxySpace or NodeProxy for live mutation.

## Conceptual Summary

DITTO is not about cloning sound.  
It is about **learning how something behaves**, then _trying_ to be that thing under imperfect cognition.

If you want, the next logical extensions are a DITTO-COLONY swarm variant, a DITTO-MEMETIC version that copies entire patches, or a DITTO-PARASITE module that slowly overwrites other modules’ behavior.
