> **The Brahma Meta-Rack**: A modular alchemical synthesizer designed to absorb, mutate, and re-express the identities of other systems.

---

## 📖 Motivation

Traditional synthesizers are fixed voices. The **Alchemical Synthesizer** is a parasitic–symbiotic apparatus. It acquiring sonic DNA through contact, records structural traits rather than surface timbre, and recombines those traits under systemic stress. 

Modelled after **Rogue (X-Men)** and **The Thing (John Carpenter)**, this instrument is not a tool, but an ethics of contamination.

## 🏗️ Architecture: The 7-Stage Organism

Every module in the Brahma Meta-Rack adheres to a strict biological signal path:

```mermaid
graph LR
    IA[Assimilation] --> EG[Gating]
    EG --> BC[Binding Core]
    BC --> AE[Extraction]
    AE --> TE[Transmutation]
    TE --> PR[Protection]
    PR --> RR[Release]
```

1.  **IA (Input Assimilation):** Normalization and protection.
2.  **EG (Equip Gating):** Single-equip constraint state machine.
3.  **BC (Binding Core):** Signal capture and "wearing."
4.  **AE (Analysis Extraction):** Spectral and temporal trait derivation.
5.  **TE (Transmutation Engine):** Operator-based transformation.
6.  **PR (Protection/Reflection):** Sacrificial buffering and retaliation.
7.  **RR (Release Router):** Final routing and bypass logic.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- **SuperCollider** (v3.13+)
- **Pure Data** (Vanilla v0.54+)

### Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/4444J99/alchemical-synthesizer.git
cd alchemical-synthesizer
```

### Running the Ritual
1.  Launch **SuperCollider** and execute `brahma/sc/loader.scd`.
2.  Launch **Pure Data** and open `brahma/pd/main.pd`.
3.  Initiate contact via the **IA Stage** of any organism node.

## 🛠️ Development & Standards

This project follows the **Minimal Root Philosophy** and **Fidelity Stacking Absorption Protocol (FSAP)**.

- **DSP Core**: SuperCollider (`brahma/sc/`)
- **UI Surface**: Pure Data (`brahma/pd/`)
- **Ontology**: Adam Kadmon (`brahma/sc/AdamKadmon.sc`)
